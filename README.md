# Stun Gun Project

This project demonstrates the basic working principle of a stun gun using a simple prototype circuit. A **stun gun** is a device used to disable an attacker by firing electric charges. It produces **very high voltage and low current**, which makes the attack extremely painful but generally non-lethal, as the low current prevents permanent injury.

The main objective of this prototype is to **generate high voltage from a low-voltage source** and produce electric shock waves, similar to the functioning of a real stun gun.

> **Note:** This is only a prototype circuit designed strictly for educational and demonstration purposes. It should not be used to harm any person or animal.

## 🔧 Prototype Circuit

**Figure 01: Prototype circuit**

The circuit uses a **step-up transformer** to produce high voltage. This is an application of **electromagnetism**, specifically **electromagnetic induction**.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

Transformers operate based on electromagnetic induction. When an **AC current flows through the primary coil**, it creates a **varying magnetic flux**. This changing magnetic flux interacts with the secondary coil, inducing an AC voltage.

In a **step-up transformer**, the secondary coil has **more turns** than the primary coil. This results in a **higher output voltage**. In this project, the transformer increases the low-voltage input to a high voltage, creating the electric shock effect seen in stun guns.

## 📝 Summary

* High voltage, low current → painful but less likely to cause permanent injury.
* The prototype demonstrates converting low voltage to high voltage.
* The step-up transformer is the key component using electromagnetic induction.
* This project serves as an educational model of real stun gun operation.

## ⚠️ Safety Warning

* Do **not** use this circuit on living beings.
* Handle high-voltage components with care.
* Use insulated tools and follow proper safety precautions.
